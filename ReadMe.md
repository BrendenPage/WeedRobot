$$UART Communication   between STM32 and Raspberry pi$$


The code is working properly, it can transmit up to 500 Bytes per transmition. No message disorder to worry(Handled inside python part). We can customize whatever the message send from raspberry pi or stm32.  Both side can receive and transmit message.
